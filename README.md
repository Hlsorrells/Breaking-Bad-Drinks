# Drinking Bad

## Project Description

This project is a simple application that can be expanded with later features. Inspired by the TV Drama "Breaking Bad", this application provides the user with a randomly selected character from the TV show with their name, nickname, actor(ess) name, and picture. It also displays a randomly selected drink with name, ingredients, mixing instructions, and serving container.

This responsive application has a foundation in HTML, CSS and Javascript. It utilizes a Bulma CSS framework and three separate APIs. The focus was on clean and simple code that would allow for easy expansion with new features as the project developed.

## Team Coordination
Our team objective was to create a simple application that was entertaining to the user. As we began, we tried to divide the work in consideration of each members strengths and weaknesses. Lindsey and Samantha tackled selecting and learning the new CSS Framework for the project. Ashley and Heather were assigned to handle the Javascript and API tasks. To establish communication, we decided to perform daily stand-ups at least one per day and use Slack as an open communication channel between team members. To facilitate project task management, we chose to use the GitHub project tab's built in kanban feature to allow each member to freely create task items which could be claimed and tracked throughout the project.
